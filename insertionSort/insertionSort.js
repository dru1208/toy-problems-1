/**
 * Insertion sort is another basic sorting algorithm. Insertion sort
 * iterates over an array, growing a sorted array behind the current location.
 * It takes each element from the input and finds the spot, up to the current point,
 * where that element belongs. It does this until it gets to the end of the array.

// Example usage:
// insertionSort([2, 1, 3]); // yields [1, 2, 3]
