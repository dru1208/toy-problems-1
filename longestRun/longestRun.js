/**
 * Write a function that, given a string, Finds the longest run of characters
 * and returns an array containing the start and end indices of that run. If
 * there are two runs of equal length, return the first one. For example:
 *
 *   longestRun("abbbcc") // [1, 3]
 *   longestRun("aabbc")  // [0, 1]
 *   longestRun("abcd")   // [0, 0]
 *
 * Try your function with long, random strings to make sure it handles large
 * inputs well.
